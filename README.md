## Inspiration

My inspiration for this was my trip to Jakarta last Summer. I attended a lot of festivals with local stores showcasing their wares and products to the public, and I wanted to bring something similar to the US. The target audience is for people to go out to their local stores more.

## What it does

I built this app around the idea of themes, connections, and rewards with a focus on local stores.

For themes, I wanted the app to have a certain theme for each month. That theme will dictate what kind of stores will be able to participate, adding a bit of festivity to the app.

For the connections, stores would be set to a user's location. Thus the primary goal of Locale, to support local businesses, will be fulfilled. 

Next, combining rewards and connections, I added a referral feature (10% reward bonus for both parties) to encourage users to add their friends and I also added group rewards, where people in the local area can purchase and work together to get a bigger reward than the individual rewards. 

Furthermore, users can enable a 20% reward bonus by using Pur, as opposed to using other payment methods. 

## How we built it

I primarily used Swift and it's built-in UI Kit to build this project. 

## Challenges we ran into

There was a lot of challenges for this project. For one, it was a bit of a learning curve trying to utilize button, build the particular functions that make them work, and go through different screens by using different types of relationships and controllers. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I'm really proud of making something that looks really simple and clean; I really liked how it came out and the solid foundation I built. 

## What we learned

I learned so much about different controllers, how to create different functions to call certain buttons or perform actions with different objects on the storyboard.

## What's next for Locale

I really want to flesh it out and learn how to use back-end and add more functionality to develop a fully working prototype.
